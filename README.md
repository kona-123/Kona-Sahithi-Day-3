Explanation:

1. We created a *Book class* to store book details and manage availability.
2. A *User class* was made to handle users and the books they borrow or return.
3. A *Library class* was built to manage all books and users centrally.
4. We used *OOP concepts* like encapsulation, class interaction, and abstraction.
5. The *Main class* shows how books are added, users are registered, and borrowing/returning happens.
6. This mini system provides a clear understanding of how real-world data is managed using OOP in Java.
